    "## **Understanding AI Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too excited about AI's abilities, it’s important to stay realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best AI models like GPT-4 or Claude have **serious limitations**. Knowing these helps you use AI wisely and avoid surprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key AI Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Hallucinations (Making Stuff Up)**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can confidently generate text that sounds correct — but is completely false or fabricated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "You ask, *\"Who won the 2025 World Cup?\"*\n",
    "The model might invent an answer, even though it doesn't know real-world events beyond its knowledge cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Lack of True Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI doesn't \"understand\" facts like humans. It predicts the next token based on patterns — not meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Bias & Inappropriate Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can reflect biases present in its training data, leading to:\n",
    "✔️ Stereotypes\n",
    "✔️ Offensive responses\n",
    "✔️ Culturally insensitive outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Limited Memory (Context Window)**\n",
    "\n",
    "AI only remembers a certain amount of tokens per request — known as the **context window**.\n",
    "Beyond that, it forgets earlier parts of the conversation or input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **So… How do we make AI more reliable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where an exciting concept comes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "# **RAG → Retrieval-Augmented Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG combines two things:\n",
    "✔️ A powerful language model (like GPT-4)\n",
    "✔️ A private, searchable knowledge source (like your own documents, database, or website)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking the AI to \"remember everything,\" you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve** relevant information from your knowledge source\n",
    "2. **Inject** it into the prompt for the AI\n",
    "3. The AI generates a response using both its own knowledge and your provided context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why RAG is Powerful**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- Gives AI access to up-to-date, accurate information\n",
    "- Keeps your data private (you're not retraining the AI)\n",
    "- Allows domain-specific expertise (legal, medical, academic, company data, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Simple Illustration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without RAG:\n",
    "*You ask:* \"Summarize the latest company policy on remote work.\"\n",
    "The AI might guess — but it doesn't actually know your company's policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "With RAG:\n",
    "- The system retrieves the actual policy document\n",
    "- That document is sent as part of the AI's prompt\n",
    "- The AI summarizes based on real, accurate information\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **RAG in Action: What Happens Under the Hood**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You ask a question\n",
    "2. The system searches your document store or database\n",
    "3. Relevant text chunks are retrieved\n",
    "4. These chunks are sent to the AI as part of the prompt\n",
    "5. The AI generates a response using that specific context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Real-World Examples of RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ AI chatbots that answer based on your company's documentation\n",
    "✔️ AI assistants for research papers or academic notes\n",
    "✔️ Legal AI tools providing case-specific advice\n",
    "✔️ Customer support bots answering based on internal FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Quick Peek: RAG Code Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore full RAG code later, but conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Pseudo-code for RAG flow\n",
    "query = \"What is our refund policy?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "retrieved_docs = vector_search(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt = f\"Based on the following documents: {retrieved_docs} \\nAnswer: {query}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "response = llm.generate(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Coming Up In this Bootcamp**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Bootcamp, we will hack **RAG** — step by step. You'll see how to:\n",
    "- Ingest your own documents\n",
    "- Break them into chunks\n",
    "- Search them efficiently\n",
    "- Combine them with AI to get reliable, customized responses\n"
